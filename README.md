# NFC-Laundry-Card
This repository contains code regarding my attempt of creating an Application<br>
that enables me to use the NFC capabilities of smartphones and link it to my laundry card<br>
and to extract data from the card in order to find out the data contents of this card

## Motivation
My Residence has given us RFID enabled cards however we do not have a front end that keeps us up to date with the balance<br>
This is a problem because without any form of front-end you rely on memory of your balance and most times you forget and end up exhausting your credits<br>
Also another problem is that you need to communicate with the admin in order to load funds, send proof of payment and wait for your credits to be updated<br>


## Action plan
This application will be built out in phases. <br>

### Phase 1: 
I will start by coding an application that retrieves data from the laundry card<br>
This data will be extracted from the card and stored into a database and used later<br>


### Phase 2:
A front-end in order to display the data on the application that contains information such as the balance, and the machine number<br>

### Phase 3:
A payment gateway in order to avoid having to go to reception in order to load more tokens

## Learning process
(My learning process will be documented on this repository listed on different branches)
1. I will first learn how to code in Kotlin<br>
2. Making API calls in Kotlin<br>
3. Learn how to develop apps in Kotlin <br>

## Methodology
I will be using Agile Methodology whilst building this app, My project Management tool will be JetBrains Spaces<br>

## Deadline 
I should finish this Application by the end of June <br>
